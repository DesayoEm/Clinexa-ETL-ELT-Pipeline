---

## statusModule
### delayed_posting
- **Index Field:** `protocolSection.statusModule.delayedPosting`
- **Definition**:Post Prior to U.S. FDA Approval or Clearance
- Authorize NIH to post publicly clinical trial registration information for a clinical study of a device product that has not been previously approved or cleared (that would otherwise be subject to delayed posting).

### first_submit_qc_date
- **Index Field:** `protocolSection.statusModule.studyFirstSubmitQcDate`
- **Definition**: The date on which the study sponsor or investigator first submits a study record that is consistent with National Library of Medicine (NLM) quality control (QC) review criteria. The sponsor or investigator may need to revise and submit a study record one or more times before NLM's QC review criteria are met.
It is the responsibility of the sponsor or investigator to ensure that the study record is consistent with the NLM QC review criteria.
- **DataType**: NormalizedDate  
- **Reason**: No analytical value

## contactsLocationsModule

### overall_officials
- **Index Field:**  `protocolSection.contactsLocationsModule.overallOfficials`
- **Definition**:  Person(s) responsible for the overall scientific leadership of the protocol, including study principal investigator.
- **DataType**: Official[]
- **Reason**: Officials lack contact information and serve administrative/ oversight purposes only. patient matching relies on location contacts, not officials

----

## referencesModule

### references
-**Index Field:** `protocolSection.referencesModule.references`
-**Definition**: Citations to publications related to the protocol
- **DataType**: Reference[]

#### Fields
##### `citations`
- **Description**: PubMed identifier for the citation in MEDLINE
- **Data Type**: Text
- **Required**: Yes
- **Reason**: No analytical value

##### `retractions`
- **Description**: retractions of the citation
- **Data Type**: Text
- **Required**: Yes
- **Reason**: No analytical value


---

### baselineMeasuresModule
- **Index Field**: `resultsSection.baselineMeasuresModule`
- **Description**: A table of demographic and baseline measures and data collected by arm or comparison group and for the entire population of participants in the clinical study.
- **Reason for Exclusion**: Contains metadata about what baseline demographics were collected (age, gender, etc.) but not the actual measured values. 
  No analytical value. Documentation/compliance data

---

### annotationModule
- **Index Field:** `annotationSection.annotationModule`
- **Content:** Administrative metadata tracking results submission/QA workflow
- **Event Types:** RELEASE (results submitted), UNRELEASE (withdrawn), RESET (pulled back for revision)

**Reason for Exclusion:**
The annotation module tracks ClinicalTrials.gov's internal submission and quality assurance workflow, not clinical trial data. It contains administrative events like when results were submitted, withdrawn, or reset during the review process.

**Example:**
```json
{
  "unpostedResponsibleParty": "CrossComm, Inc.",
  "unpostedEvents": [
    {"type": "RELEASE", "date": "2024-09-20"},
    {"type": "RESET", "date": "2024-10-14"}
  ]
}
```

### documentSection / largeDocModule

- **Index Field:** `documentSection`, `protocolSection.largeDocModule`
- **Content:** File attachments (protocols, consent forms, statistical analysis plans)
  - **Reason for Exclusion:** Links to documents, not structured data. Files would need separate download and parsing. 
            Study protocols and documents are not used in patient matching or R&D analytics models. 
---


### miscInfoModule
- **Index Field:** `derivedSection.miscInfoModule`
- **Content:** System metadata, removed countries, results submission workflow tracking

**Reason for Exclusion:**

**1. Version Holder**
- System metadata (last successful ClinicalTrials.gov data ingestion timestamp)
- Not clinical or analytical data
- No relevance to patient matching or R&D analytics

**2. Removed Countries**
- Historical record of countries where all study locations were closed/removed
- Already reflected in current study_locations table (active sites only)
- Patient matching uses current locations, not historical changes
- Weak analytical signal for R&D (doesn't predict outcomes)

**3. Submission Tracking**
- Detailed workflow metadata (release dates, reset dates, Major Comment Postings)
- Tracks ClinicalTrials.gov QA/review cycles
- Similar to annotationModule - administrative process, not clinical data
- Number of submission resets/MCPs is weak predictor of trial quality
