    """
    Extract central contacts and study site locations from a clinical trial.

    Central contacts are the primary points of contact for trial inquiries
    Locations are the physical sites where thE trial is conducted,
    which may include hospitals, clinics, or research centers across multiple countries.

    Location records include optional geocoordinates when available, enabling
    geographic analysis and proximity-based patient matching.

    Site-specific contact information and recruitment status are stored in the bridge table
    as they represent the study-location relationship rather than the location
    itself.

    Args:
        study_key: Unique identifier for the clinical trial study.
        study_data: Flattened study record containing nested contact and
            location data

    Returns:
        Four-element tuple containing:
            - central_contacts: Contact dimension records
            - study_central_contacts: Bridge table linking studies to contacts
            - locations: Location dimension records
            - study_locations: Bridge table with study-specific location data


        All lists return empty if no contacts/locations exist for the study.
